Data Science & AI Learning Repository

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository is my **learning and practice space** for Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.  
Iâ€™m a self-taught beginner, currently exploring Python, ML algorithms, Deep Learning, and data analysis techniques.
 What Iâ€™m Learning
- Python for data analysis (NumPy, Pandas)
- Machine Learning basics (Scikit-learn)
- Deep Learning (TensorFlow & PyTorch)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Working with real-world datasets (Kaggle tutorials)

My Current Practice Projects
- Titanic Survival Prediction (Kaggle)
- Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix dataset
- Beginner Machine Learning models
- Sentiment Analysis on text data

> These projects are currently **based on tutorials and examples**, and I am recreating them to strengthen my understanding.

My Goals
- Build my own small data projects  
- Share my learning progress and projects on GitHub  
- Apply for Data Science internships in Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­
